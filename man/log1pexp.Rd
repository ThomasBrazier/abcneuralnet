\title{Compute the log1pexp trick}
\usage{
log1pexp(x, threshold = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a tensor}

\item{threshold}{the threshold value under which the trick is applied to avoid \code{Inf} values}
}
\value{
a tensor with values corrected with the log1pexp trick
}
\description{
This is a more stable version of log(1 + exp(x)). Note that log(1 + exp(x)) is approximately equal to x when x is large enough.
